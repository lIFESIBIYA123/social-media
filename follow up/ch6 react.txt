To build a React application, you’ll need the following stack:

    • Application code: React, Redux, ESLint, Prettier, and React Router
    • Build tools: Webpack, Uglify, npm/yarn/pnpm, and babel
    • Testing tools: Jest and Enzyme

Creating the React project

Before creating the React project, we need to have tools installed for a better development experience. 
These tools are drivers, editors, and plugins basically. Let’s start by installing Node.js.

Installing Node.js

Creating and running a React app

1. Run the following command to create a React application:
 npm create vite@latest social-media-app

This command will create a React application named social-media-app. If you are using 
npm, then replace yarn with npx
------------------------------

Installing a debugging plugin in the browser

To debug React applications, we have to install React Developer Tools, a plugin available on Chrome, 
Firefox, and Edge browsers. You can find the plugin for the Chrome version at https://chrome.
google.com/webstore/category/extensions and the Firefox version at https://
addons.mozilla.org. The plugin looks something like this:

CONFIGURING THE PROJECT
Before starting to write the authentication flow, let’s make sure that the project is ready for coding. In 
this section, we will configure styling and routing, and allow the request on the API.
Let’s start with routing first.

ADDING REACT ROUTER
Routing in a frontend application represents everything that deals with moving from one view to 
another and loading the right page using the right URL.
command:
yarn add react-router-dom@6
-----
edit the index.js file like so:
src/main.jsx
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDom from 'react-dom/client'
    import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom"
    import './index.css'
    import App from './App.jsx'

    // creating the root applicatin component
    const root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

    root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
        </BrowserRouter>
    </React.StrictMode>
    );
------

Adding React Bootstrap

Fortunately, the React ecosystem provides a package called react-bootstrap independent of JQuery.
Run the following command to install the package:
yarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap
-----
Next, import the bootstrap CSS file into the main.jsx file like so:
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
-----
With react-router and react-bootstrap installed, let’s create a quick page using both of 
these in the next subsection.
-----
CREATING THE HOME PAGE

Creating a page in React using React Router follows this pattern most of the time:
    • Creating the component and the page
    • Registering the page in BrowserRouter with an URL

Follow these steps to create the Home page:
    1. Create a directory in src called pages.
    2. Inside the pages directory, create a new file called Home.jsx:

    SRC/PAGES/Home.jsx
            import React from "react";

            function Home() {
                return(
                    <div>
                        <h1>profile</h1>
                        <p>
                            welcome
                        </p>
                    </div>
                )
            }

            export default Home;

------------------------------------
Register this page in the App.js file:
src/App.js

import React from "react";
import { Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";

function App() {
  return(
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}

export default App;

----------
Configuring CORS
CORS stands for cross-origin resource sharing. It’s a browser mechanism that enables controlled
access to resources located outside of a given domain.
It helps prevent cross-domain attacks or unwanted requests. In the case of this project, the React 
project is running on http://127.0.0.1:3000.
If we try to make some requests from the browser, we’ll receive an error. Open the React application 
at http://127.0.0.1:3000 and open Developer Tools:
-----------
Let’s quickly configure the Django API side by following these steps:
1. Enable CORS with Django REST by using django-cors-headers:
pip install django-cors-headers

2. If the installation of the django-cors-headers package is complete, go to your settings.
py file and add the package into INSTALLED_APPS and the middleware:

CoreRoot/settings.py

        INSTALLED_APPS
            'corsheaders',

        MIDDLEWARE 
            'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
            'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',

-----
Add these lines at the end of the settings.py file:
CoreRoot/settings.py
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
    ]

Useful ES6 and React features
s ECMAScript 2015, is a significant enhancement in the JavaScript language 
that allows developers to write programs for complex applications with better techniques and patterns.

With React, we have moved from writing classes to writing components using functions and React 
Hooks
